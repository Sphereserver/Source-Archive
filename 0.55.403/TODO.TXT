- Add @PartyJoin, @PartyLeave and @PartyInvite.
- Add SERV.MAPTILE(x, y).  ( k: there is already SERV.MAP(x,y) ? )
- Add LIGHT to control light independantly for characters. (Radiant: done 12-04-2004, might need to be changed to use local light packet instead)
- newequip (creates a new item, equips it), newloot (creates a new item or loot template, sticks it on a corpse in @death events), 
- equipprops (example equipprops 10.0 magery, 10 dex - would give 10.0 magery and 10 dex on equip, remove it on unequip, placed in @Create on an item)
  ( k: doable by adding a simple resourcegroup field to items/itemdefs )
- precasting
- try to get STAT_MEMORY_INFO from system process information routines to get rid of overloaded operators
- get TRIGGER=@trigger to work in EVENTS (seph said they dont, confirmed)
- database support via libmysql. at least accounts information should be able to lay configurable in db or base
  in the future, move all the rest other to sql (configurable). it will remove the need of saves (or not if each sql
  save will slow down), but will make almost impossible for rollback without previous save
  could also be ODBC, but it is much slower and odbc has some bad limitations
- new map support
- useful 99/1.0 features (maybe some are already in, just copy-pasted, my comment in brackets - Vjaka):
  profiles saved (means that middle)
  Regions on diff map plane but with same area is ok. (not conflict) (useful for new map)
  ON=@UserClick (differnet from @Click)
  MOUNTID for chars that have mount objects
  VAR.X1 = VAR.X[1] for array name parsing
  CHAR.TAG.PARTY_CANLOOTME
  blocking ip range
  Script error will jump out of current block. (should simulate endif)
  TAG.CORPSEID for CHARDEF to change the corpse.
  NPC's will use DISPEL if they have it.
  Each summon spell type can have it's own timer DURATION.
  try not to cast useless evil spells
  allow NPC to accidently hurt it's pets.
  Allow NPC to summon pets.
  gold weighs 1/100 of a stone.
  .Add multi directly? (i_multi_cannon_s)
  HTTPPORT = put http requests on another port.
  X loot from blue says you need to steal ?
- Magicresistance not working
- Provocation not working
- Check guild system to be usable and fully powerful
- NPC AI system
  pathfinding (at least limited to 180 degrees or like that)
  some npc ai code is #if 0 - cause of Npc_SearchFood problems. need to fix that stuff
  npc should eat food if have some on ticking food
  npc should be able to search for food on ticking food around of it
- Make threads working on Unix and then
  move socket operations (at least packets receiving) to another thread. could cause some problems with non-volatiles, but
    it is a must
- Need investigation what exactly causes sphere not being very fast
- sector/region.clients - number of clients in (same in region)
- Arrays for tags/vars variable[x] = ... (no need of EVAL in brackets)
- Having CONSUME consume more than 65k of an item at once
- Working ON=@SUCCESS Trigger on all skills. Skills on which it doesn't work right now : 
  Parrying 
  Camping 
  Archery / Swordsmanship / Fencing / Macefightning / Wrestling / Tactics 
  Tracking 
  Meditation (It works, but while meditating, it gets triggered every 1/10 second.) 
  Stealth (Gets triggered, just like hiding, but doesn't get triggered when one successfully walks hidden) 
- ON=@Kill trigger for weapons/chars
- Logs the uid of every added items, actually: 00:33:5c:'staff_nalfgar' commands 'add i_robe'=1 UID : <UID>
- I'd like to see a fixed rainchance=0 /coldchance=0. although i set these values in every region, it still ains/snows sometimes. 
- SERV.ALLNPCS, SERV.ALLREGIONS, SERV.ALLITEMS, SERV.ALLOBJS, SERV.ALLPLAYERS
- damtype for itemdef base = 0002 | 0010 // physical & fire
- ON=@CharDCLICK
- ON=@CREATE for player chars
- TIMER2 for chars with ON=@Timer triggeting
- New script system with scripts precompiled on loading and only the binary execution will take place
  it will cause some language changes.
- interesting bug with .xstone: when you try to unstone an NPC on 203 client it crashes
- in dialog "try LOCAL... " does not work. dunno know why since dialogs do not have local vars? shit happens :)
- TAB in a console should be used for auto-proceeding the paths useful for serv.load ... etc
- If VERSION=xxx is set in save files where xxx is not numeric (like R3rc3) the saves will corupt the server when load.
