Fearan: bandages just seem to dissapear, even on .55i, happens since .55h
Fearan: hey menace, how do we use INPVAL in a script? I tried a few things, not successful

thx for your time
Fearan: t_bandage should be in the trig.scp since right now it's hard coded and im sure many people would like to change stuff in it
Fearan: btw fishing doesnt work: you get the try mining in water msg even when mining in water
Fearan: bolts of clothes need to be more expensive: if you buy a bolt of clothe (default scripts, i edited mine after) then cut it, you get 50 folded cloths (fine up to there) but if you resell your folded cloth 3x50 you get a little profit of ~30gp
Fearan: a feature that would be good

REDKARMA in the ini would be good, right now you cant set when someone becomes red, you can only do it when your at like -5000 from neutral so it'd be good to have a custom setting to become red


Fearan: potion bug : if you take a blue potion, then a white potion, your dex goes down 12 permanently

lag spikes ?

Sir Parish: spawns with morez=0 (maxdist) should make npcs with a real homedist 0,   without a maxdist they get a homedist of 32767 and walk around the whole world
Sir Parish: hi dennis, t_trash_can, doesn't work as gm

Sir Parish: hi,
is it possible to ignore invalid old keywords like QUALTIY on startup?

	problem with turning ships, the single parts(hatch, planks, tillerman) are wrong after turn command 

when GMs answer pagers their characters sometimes get deleted (the GM's character)
Fearan: healers dont heal neutrals, there should be an option to turn that on

run out of the box. No INI file required.

.set flags 4 to freeze him and he insta-died.
	then when i ressed him he kept his death shroud.

no sparring for a long time before goin to war is frustrating but can be handled 
but resignin towns and loggin off need changes.  

1 resigning - a person can resign a town while you are attacking him then call the 
guards on you or what happened to me last night i killed a guy i let him live after 
than he resigned his town few minutes later he walked close by me and my char auto 
attacked him i got guardwhacked(can we say insane?)  

2 often when you start killing someone in town they will log off making their 
char disappear(whats the point to war if they just log off to be safe?)  ps guys 
that make a wad of bears THEN join a town and attack you needs fixed also means if 
you are gonna be safe you need to take out the bears of everyone around you incase they 
do join the town thats a fast way to make people mad for no reason	


if you double click your axe, and then on a tree it says something like 
	'try chopping a tree' after numerous trys all over the globe, 
	I found that if you chop at a tree with your daggar (make some kindling! WHOOHOOO!) 
	you can then chop the tree with your axe, afterwards. Hope this helps anybody else 
	who's having trouble with this!


@INPVAL for a simple value input !

console - turn Off logging, you cant turn it on

3) Provocation still :)

4) A function's for skill menus to got a dialog

There's also some problem with healing animals with bandages (veterinary). When you start healing them it keeps on healing at a quick rate, as if you were holding down "last object / last target" macro button

npc speech is name color !

allow "quoted" strings in the scripts.

You attack the vesper bank, then have a friend gate you to trinsic and do last target.  You attack the banker all day long from another city.

the +x on magic weapons are too high, ruin's are +3 instead of +1, etc

3d client - move object in pack is duplicated

memory = disposition toward char ? -100 = hate , 100 = love, 200 = pet ?

generic client events ? @LoginFail @Login ?

9) Provocation getting closer, however the provoker gets guard whacked, thats good, but after getting killed,
 if they come back and yell guards, the person they provoked is getting killed.
flagging grey when using provocation
	needs to flag criminal if used on a blue person right away, 
	and should not give the person that got flagged a criminal flag 
	if they hit the person that provoked them
Provocation, they need to go criminal as soon as they target a blue player

7) Pets, when they are attacked first, but the pet kills someone you go criminal
people are getting flagged criminal if someone attacks their pet, 
	and then their pet attacks back,

TEST - monster s casting = fail all the time 

28. Monsters do not give karma and fame after you reach about 200 of each.

11) Skill gain seems a little weird on a lot of things, adjusting the settings in the TABLE.SCP does not seem to help this.

CHECK - gm says the command "all go" to a npc, all the players then say "Yes Master" 
when a gm says "all transfer" the players all say "Sorry" then if the gm causes them harm, like cast a firefield and they walk into it, the players all say they decide they are better off without theyre masters.  
taming appears to be very very slow.  someone spent over 20 minutes trying to tame a horse with no skill gain.
Player decides better off as own master ?

crypt dll ? or Crypt key in Resource SCP ?

inscription doesnt use mana

account starting with number ? unused delete. or show in accounts file ?

delete unused chars after x days ?

3. Magic resist, think needs to be a bit less, seems better, but tends to resist too mcu
	CHECK - magic Resist has no effect ?

7. House tags are saving, but something weird seems to be happening during the save or 
	round abouts where it says cant find the tag 
	(Undefined Symbol")
	But the tag is still their, so maybe just squelch those messages, not too sure...

9. On stealth, seem to be able to tab out of the stealthing 
	but gain skill, so therefore you seem to be able to gain skill fast.

CHECK - 3d client bad packet mesages.
	? 2.0.8s mames kbad packet 04 ?

CHECK - Error messge with multi's ?
? QUALITY undefined on reload? use as % markup for quality NOT range.

INI setting for updating accounts, so two servers can run off the same account file.

change dialog to ON=@Create ON=@Text

Magery:
10) Precasting spells = Sparkle Effect when targetting ?
2) Magic Reflection seems to reflect all spells, it should only reflect a percentage of the spell depending on the Magic Reflect Skill you have.

Poison:
Posioning, where is the effect and time controlled from? TABLES_X appeared to have no effect on it
-Poison by a spider only lasted a few secounds, I did have very high stats, maybe this was the reason.  

TEST- cure poison

Poison Skill 
	2x click potion, select item to poison, nothing after that.  
	Poisoned food will not poison the victim who eats it. 

Provoke/Entice:
	Provocation appears not to work right, click on another player they turn grey that will solve that I believe
	Provacation still buggy can provacate in town npcc and players  
	Provocation still weird  back to being one man armies (monsters are a tiny bit too weak at least some of them) 
	also Provocation works with no music instrument. And the target attack myself, instead of the one that i asked for.  

	If you walk into town, provoke someone and then tab out, that someone gets g whacked. 
	They turn criminal. (not the aggressor but the aggresse.
	The enticement is still screwy, the person can entice another player in town then tab out of war mode, 
	walk by the player, let them hit them, then call guards and they get guard whacked.

Taming:
(taming skill 50.1)  I can tame:  Mustang  zostrich ?Drake?
	-Raven and snakes not tameable	
	use tame skill on more than 50 pets (with a lot try) but i have no gain any skill 

Runebook:
4) Need a way to recall of a object without being able to rename it when double clicking it
6) Need an input variable like when you rename a rune, to get a value from the charceter when prompted
impliment arrays of a sort 

Other:

5) Need a way to search Memory Objects on a charecter (If they have more than one of the same type)

8) ON=@CREATE trigger need a way that when a player makes the item you can check a skill on them to decide a value on the new item

9) When targetting a player they should go grey, not when they actually hit someone

- t_campfire should have damage onstep  

TRUE: testserver brightness changes (sector wise) like any version - its really stupid to have pitch black night one inch away from bright day	 
  
city latern lightradius is at bottom of latern not where its alight (on top)  
  
Boats:
  players cant get off boats. can't seem to use gangplank - is this related to guests not having keys?  
  boats don't run correctly.
  boats turning lose parts ?
	plank animation to open can be messed up if the ship has turned.

Spell Rez:
	Ressurection by a gm sometimes leaves the deathrobe on the player, he can even put it in his pack.  

Skills/Stats advance
	Slow skill/stat gain (all potions, various skill levels)  
	Stats kept decaying. Whenever I set a players str to 100, he/she would tell me later it steadly decayed down. Maybe the stat cap is set odd on the test server? 
	Failure rate is very low - seems fail only when trying to use another mortar (all potions, various skill levels)  

	there seems to be a problem with stat increases...i've been fighting over the last few days and
	i've gotten increases in str and dex but as soon as you open a corpse, bag, or door you loose the stat 
	again not sure what's happening(happened in .55 w/client 2.0.3)

casting / skill interruption by attack damage based on skill ?
u can't cast spells while fighting to heal urself.  Players are saying it is do to dex being to fast.

default resurrection and cure poison scripts need tweaking, 

Combat:
	You rarely miss your hits  
	hard to miss with bow ?	
	archery too fast at high dex !!!
	Daggers and Cleavers and Wrestling are super fast.
	combat does way too much damage ?!
	using a battle axe still looks like you are chopping trees (toofast)  
	CHECK - High dex fighting = can;t leave ? prevent run from a monster while fighting ?

-When trying to run away from a combat, i ALWAYS bounce back to the monster... this makes impossible to fight... expecially for mages and archers wich can't have a very strong armor  (Sera's comment- have told Menace bout this before. As a player when fighting its like the monster is pulling you back. You can't hit, run or anything else. usually end up dying)
	if u have a 100 dex u cant run - have noted this problem before - 
	when u r fighting its like being drawn back to the monster. 
	u cant escape 

Making Items:

[ ] Can make potion kegs, but cannot sell them (bug or not?)  
[ ] Can't make sextant from sextant parts (script issue, not able to do so in v0.51a either)  
[ ] barrel hoops, metal box (small brass color), metal chest (gray w/gold trim), barrel (open top/closed top), keg (open top), ring, dartboard,keg w/tap, barrel tap 
  
Alchemy : Fury, Bafomet, Gaia, Vaschina	
potions creation consumes any reags on char, not ones selected (either by dclick of reag or mortar select).  

- Confirmed Boards bug (log to board, if one board exists in backpack, no log is deleted and no board added.)

- boards can be "crafted by"
- boards take forever to make 

- failing to often on "carpentry bench" (it took me 6 tries to do all 3 parts as GM carpenter
- missing a lot of parts from the bar 

Blood Rock:
- works, but i am missing a blood rock kite shield to smith

- asks for cut up leather when doing armors and stuff, but works with normal hides

- you can not create cut up leather (use scissors on hides won't work, its not hair or cloth)
- you can not create drums without cut up leather, so thats one i couldn't do.
- couln't do much jewelry, since i was missing gold and silver. (excecption: bead necklace)

27. After sparring with someone, you can incure a kill count if they happen to die 
	from anything later on, say a wraith kills them. This would be ok if it wasn't 
	30 mins after you were sparring them. 30 mins is a tad bit excessive.

entrances to dungeons guarded ?

There is a trigger ON=@Death but it does not identify the killer. 
There is alos not a trigger ON=@kill, hmm maybe there should be. Or possibly better trigger use for 
the @NPCSeeWantItem for when a monster sees a body on the ground. I'll put that on the list of triggers 
to better support. I really do like the idea.

check potion kegs? forgetting what they are and dispencing randomly anything from castle deeds to rare ore... kinda weird

TEST- cast while using particle form ?

vendors stock blank maps

m_Act_Difficulty avail in script ?
// Extract Multi's ??? 

?. Can't stop hair growth? I mean its like its on mirical grow. Tryed slowing down the game clock to no avail.

20. "I resign from my guild" at deathblow giving the other person a kill, I say if you resign from a guild you should get a criminal tag, just resign outside of town and wait your three mintues.

Party System:
	When a party gets over 10 people everyone in the party crashes and will continue to crash when they try to log back in. Please try to put a limiter on the party system so that they can't get over 10 players. This mostly occurs when people use the /add command because they don't see how many are in the party 
	and unknowingly screw it all up.
	remove 1 from party ?

Mining/Smelting:
	When a player has over 100 mining in non real show when they smelt ore they actually get more ingots 
		than they had ore, same with armors.
	seems you can re-mine before a previous mine completes (ie no "you must wait for another task to complete" error.) I tried doing it deliberately a few times, seems to be no advange to doing so, if you re-mine it immediately makes the previous mine fail, and you dont seem to gain any levels, so the "exploitation" factor seems pretty low.
 
Economy Problems:
	Logs sell for 1 gold per, while arrow shafts can be made of them and sold for 6. 
	Fish can be bought for less than the 4 fish steaks sell for that you get when you cut them up.
	Pitchers of cider can be bought for 6 and the empty pitchers sold back for 43 gold. 
	Iron ingots can be bought for 4 gold and sold for 7.
	Buy a bolt of cloth cut it up into bandaids, sell banaids, and you will make more than the price of the bolt. 
	Same with cut cloth. Also if you cut up a bolt into cloth and sell imediately 
		sometimes you can sell each piece of cloth for the price of a bolt.

	No price variance on things made by people with different skill levels.

	Innkeepers sell vendor deeds for 1 gold, which can easily flood a shard with vendors.

Player Vendors:
	Player Vendors go wild unless a gm sets the food to 9999. I'm sure this one has been reported, but again I'm just making sure.

24. Looms get clogged easily, it says "You remove the previously uncompleted weave."
 but never actually does anything. The looms either have to be remade or the
  more1 set to 0 I believe.

6. monster guards for jhelom - please set them up?

CHECK - Delay on leaving town or a guild stone

CHECK - walk through side of new wiz tower.

Titles not showing in titles from guilds… But do show on char tag

Not able to cut up leather. scissors.

first boot up on fresh install (clean worldfile/account), lag was horrible.  
	Created char, saved, shut down.  started it up.. 0 lag

problem still with a stat loss, 
In the skillclass, I have the DEX, STR, INT 
all set to 100, and then set the total stat to 350 thinking
 that would allow people to go over if they have a stat 
 altering spell cast on them... wrong, they still loose stat?

4. Fishing through docks still exists.

11. Stamina loss happens much too fast while running, even with 100 str and few items in backpack.

Guild Stones:
 
2nd up, more guild stone issues..
after apparently solving the add player prob, (even tho there is no message telling you, the player has to double click on the stone after being added to become a member) another has appeared
 
Maybe put a message in for the player recruited, that they have been recruited and that they have to visit the stone to confirm?
 
world hasnt got wrap enabled, so if you go too far in one direction, you hit a wall of "rough water" and you cant sail around the world. (which is painful when the place you need to be is just 5 mins sail, but you have to go 3 hours sailing around the continent to get there.)
 
TEST- Tamed Dragon - can't feed ? all the food I drag onto it just goes into its backpack (It came out when I said 'all drop')
 
9) Bless Spell
 
Seems that every player like to cast bless in everyone....this is cheap......
eveytime statt loss.its aint right when u can drop another player stats only casting 
friendly spell.If it is not working correctly and it only brings bad feelings in players 
and gms......why not disabled it??? for now Bless is so powerfull than any other spell.......
seems that pks dont use kal vas flam or paralyze ONLY BLESS and everytime permanent statt 
loss.........
 
This also happens if you make lets say a sword that gives you +15 STR on equip, 
well if you go over your allowed 100 and continue to equip the sword, your stats start 
to fall..
  
12) Script Interrupt and delay:
 
Is there anyway in a script to have the script flow interruppted while running because of an attack?
 
Also, a delay in the script? I mean to actualy pause the script in mid stream for such and such a period before conitnuing?
  
14) Economy:
 
I know we talked about it once, but it would be real nice to have NPC's start to pay more for well 
crafted items...
 
This is something I get alot of complaints about becuase the GM Skill'd people feel they get ripped 
for all their hard work to GM, when along comes a newbie and can sell an item for the same price.
 
 
15) Names On GM'd Crafted Items:
 
Name limit? It cuts off the name of the person who crafted the item if it is too long, anyway of fixing this?

Server name should be same character set as account name and email address ?

Skill remove trap is functional, When trap removed, its animation starts and is still continous 
as when is lowered. when trap removed (for the time in which is switched off) can be coloured to red 
or green, but without animation.

If i use the command act.bounce with a stackable item and the Char has reached max stones in his backpack, 
the newitem will drop down at the ground, but not with the correct amount, the item will drop down as 
the doubled amount. If i put in a act.amount_, the program adds 20 amount. If i move the line act.amount 
after act.bounce, i'll get the correct amount of the newitem but the wrong picture until i use fix ore 
move the added item. I wrote a simple trigger to show you the problem. Make a Char with 100 Strength and 
give him some logs, now set the amount of the logs to 266, thats the max carrying weight for a char with 
130 strength (thats possible with potions and spells) deaktiviate GM, then walk over the exampletrigger.... 
the adjusted amount of goldcoins drop at the ground, but not with amount 10....

How to get players to climb over hills 
There is a path near the Ophidian area in T2A from the north which joins to the desert. As gm I can climb this but as a normal player i'm stuck low and cant climb over it. The z at the bottom ranges from -2 to -5 and it is 39 at the top. Is there a setting i can change to allow normal players to climb this sort of height or some way of putting some step up tiles to help the players over. This is a great hunting spot. I'm sure someone must have a way to use it. 
	re: get me the actual co-ords and I can investigate it to see if a change to TUSmap is in order .. I handle map revisions. However, chars are limited by the client to steping up a max of 2Z , not much we can do about that. Placing hidden/quiet teleports which raises only your z position up a step is a great fix to some unwalkable areas and doesn't show as bad to gameplay as teleporting to a new place. 
	The co-ordinates are 5723,2672,-4   by Esadie  ID = 1028826  
NOTE: Confirmed. GM characters (in GM mode and not) can walk this path .. players cannot.

TRUE - fix ?
Problem with flagging - players are attacking out of town and then coming back in and are still flagged to the person attacked, thus guards can be called on them. Also reports that the flag 'sticks' on so that any approach into a guarded area causes guards to come .. even days afterwards.
NOTE: Can't reproduce locally while alone
check notes on see Criminal act and ability to call guards .


==========================================================================

VERIFY THIS
Traps (TYPE=25):
 they work good, but problem is with their animations. When somebody walks across or push some kind 
of trap their animation work only once and, at the second time ( when somebody walk across...) 
they work, but animations don´t ). Problem is that in MORE there is for example number of one trap 
111c (animation) and after walking or pushing that trap number is 111b, which isn´t animation.
Note: the problem is not with it resetting to the base # .. in this case 111b. The problem is it 
never recycles back into the next ID # for the animation upon reactivation. So you only get 
the damage. 

==========================================================================

Forensics
When a player calls a guard to kill an attacker ... Using forensic evaluation on the body of Attacker, 
the murderer name will be the name of the player who called the guards. Suggest changing it to simply 
say :  Killed by Guards .. or something to that effect.
NOTE: Still does in 46M

Cooking:
You can't combine flour and water to create dough
