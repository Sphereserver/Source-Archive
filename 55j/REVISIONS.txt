With GM or PC, if you try to fill a keg with potion you get the you cannot use this yet message. I have a mortar and pestle. Tested at GM alchemy skill for both GM and PC.
In UO3D, if you log into an account that has no characters, you get a message

CAN'T FIND THIS- they don't count fists or daggers as a criminal offence,

CALL FOR GUARDS WORKS FOR ME - Just hit the blue npc or player one time in war mode. The aggressor WILL NOT
 be flagged criminal until the victim die. Or the aggressor can go in peace
 mode and let the blue attack. The blue will become grey to him and finally
 the aggressor will kill the blue and loot him without any problems. I tested
 it, it works. Some players seem to use this for kill any blues in town.

x You put the logss in your pack
x. Also you can smelt Chaos and Order shields to get gold and blackrock ingots in mass amounts with no or little work.
x. Also with the guild stones, you can recruit the guildmaster making him a candidate and 
	take over the guild stone and kick everyone out. Warring guilds tend to make mules and do this sort of thing.
18. Many guild bugs. Players can be "half-way" in a guild now. 
	The result is other waring guilds are now orange to you and 
	you are blue to them. They can be half way in the guild two 
	ways. 
	18.1. Have the guildmaster never accept you fully in. 
	18.2. after the guildmaster accepts you in, don't click the stone. You can actually end up half way in a guild with your guild tag on. 

19. Another guild bug is people will make a charater with 10 str 
	and then join it to a guild thats either Chaos or Order. 
	Then go attack greens, the player will auto attack back and 
	easily kill the player with 10 str. Thusly giving them a kill
	they get guard killed and a near by guildmate loots the corpse of the person that got attacked by the guy with 10 str. No criminal tags are incured on either the looter or the attacker due to the fact that the target was green.

BUG-Can't make all items?


6/28/2000 - 53h
Work on Skill Menus, stored MORE values, Alchemy.
must add CAN_REPLICATE flag to arrows and bolts for skill creation.
must add new TYPEs to the scripts 
no more permanant NIGHTSIGHT for GM's, Must use the .NIGHTSIGHT toggle.
Kill weighted ranges. they are not well defined anyhow. to make a weigted range use { { 0 10 } 5 { 34 500 } 3 0 10 } 
Dead players see the Undead SEASON world.

6/26/00 - 53g

ok , here's a basic outline of the change to the scripts sections SKILLMENU (SKILLS.SCP), ITEMDEF (ITEMx.SCP) and CHARDEF (CHARx.SCP)

get rid of BUYVALUE replace with VALUE=value for low quality, value for high quality
so the example VALUE=1,10 would mean that you would be able to buy from a vendor that likes you a low quality item for 1 and a high quality item for 10

get rid of SELLVALUE
 
remove RESOURCE=x items from [SKILLMENU x], put RESOURCES= in [ITEMDEF x] to replace the old (never used) MATERIALS=

remove TEST SKILLNAME=xx.x from [SKILLMENU x], put SKILLMAKE=SKILLNAME xx.x,SKILLNAME xx.x
for the specific item that is being made.
 
Now for the most difficult
Put item instance specific stuff after ON=@Create in both ITEMDEF and CHARDEF blocks.
so for example
 
[CHARDEF 02]
DEFNAME=ETTIN_W_AXE
NAME=Ettin
SOUND=MONSTER_ETTIN1
ICON=PET_ETTIN
ANIM=078c7f
CAN=MT_WALK|MT_USEHANDS|MT_EATRAW
DAM=4,20
ARMOR=19
RESOURCES=8 ME
FOODTYPE=MEAT 15 (3)
STR={135 165}
DEX={56 75}
INT={31 55}
PARRYING={50.0 60.0}
MAGICRESISTANCE={40.0 55.0}
TACTICS={50.0 70.0}
WRESTLING={50.0 60.0}
NPC=brain_monster
FAME=5000
KARMA={-2000 -2999}
DESIRES=ETTINS,ROCKS
ITEM=ETTIN_LOOT
CATEGORY=Monsters
SUBSECTION=Ettins, Ogres, Trolls, Cyclops, and Titans
DESCRIPTION=Ettin
 
should be:
 
[CHARDEF 02]
DEFNAME=ETTIN_W_AXE
NAME=Ettin
SOUND=MONSTER_ETTIN1
ICON=PET_ETTIN
ANIM=078c7f
CAN=MT_WALK|MT_USEHANDS|MT_EATRAW
DAM=4,20
ARMOR=19
RESOURCES=8 ME
FOODTYPE=MEAT 15 (3)
DESIRES=ETTINS,ROCKS
 
ON=@Create
STR={135 165}
DEX={56 75}
INT={31 55}
PARRYING={50.0 60.0}
MAGICRESISTANCE={40.0 55.0}
TACTICS={50.0 70.0}
WRESTLING={50.0 60.0}
NPC=brain_monster
FAME=5000
KARMA={-2000 -2999}
ITEM=ETTIN_LOOT
CATEGORY=Monsters
SUBSECTION=Ettins, Ogres, Trolls, Cyclops, and Titans
DESCRIPTION=Ettin
 
 
other general pronciples of scripting:
try to put DEFNAME= toward the top of the [] block
try to use DEFNAME constants whenever possible instead of the hard coded numbers. (ex. MAKEITEM=04573 should be MAKEITEM=GOLDEN_CHAINMAIL_COIF

if fact
 
ONOPTION=04573 Golden Chainmail Coif (10 ingots)
RESOURCE=10 GOLD_INGOT
TEST BLACKSMITHING=28.6
MAKEITEM=04573 
 
should now be:
 
ONOPTION=GOLDEN_CHAINMAIL_COIF Golden Chainmail Coif (10 ingots)
MAKEITEM=GOLDEN_CHAINMAIL_COIF

...
 
[ITEMDEF 04573]
DEFNAME=GOLDEN_CHAINMAIL_COIF
RESOURCES=10 GOLD_INGOT
SKILLMAKE=BLACKSMITHING 28.6

CHECK "mislinked member uid" on guildstone at shutdown.
CHECK npc's call guards when attacked, 
CHECK kill count when attacking warring guild ?

Add -Tscriptfilename.scp to command line for testing.

changes to scripts SKILLMENU (SKILLS.SCP), ITEMDEF (ITEMx.SCP) and CHARDEF (CHARx.SCP)
get rid of BUYVALUE replace with VALUE=value for low quality, value for high quality
get rid of SELLVALUE

remove RESOURCE=x items from [SKILLMENU x], put RESOURCES= in [ITEMDEF x] to replace MATERIALS=
remove TEST SKILLNAME=xx.x from [SKILLMENU x], put SKILLMAKE=SKILLNAME xx.x,SKILLNAME xx.x

Put item instance specific stuff after ON=@Create in ITEMDEF and CHARDEF blocks.

remove POTIONDEFS in favor of just creating new items !

6/5/2000
[AREA x] blocks may now have TAG.x extensions
TAG.GUARDOWNER
TAG.ANNOUCEMENT
TAG.GUARDID=0 = no auto spawned guards.
TAG.GUARDID=xxx = some other guard body.

5/31/2000
More resource scripting. New types seem to be working.
Create new TAG. extensions for all Chars. saved in world file.

// support old versions that just had special files with [xxxx] entries
// DEFS.SCP - has no section headers, need DEFNAME header.
// MENU.SCP changes headers for ITEMMENU GMMENU, GUILDMENU and ADMIN
// SKILL.SCP needs new SKILLMENU header
// HELP.SCP needs HELP header.
// NEWB.SCP needs NEWBIE header
// NAME.SCP needs NAMES header.
//
// These convert automatically.
// ITEM.SCP needs ITEMDEF header
// CHAR.SCP needs CHARDEF header.
// TEMPLATE.SCP needs TEMPLATE header
// SPEE.SCP needs SPEECH header
//
// MAP.SCP LOCAL has changed to DEFNAME

5/25/2000
Change the scripts to use the new unified format!
SPHERE.INI, SPHERETABLE.SCP are read in at startup
All other SCP files in the directory and scripts directory will be pre-indexed for resources.
in the future direct number id for items and chars are to only be used for client artwork purposes.
But we prefer that the DEFNAME= be used instead.
indexing will occur in listed order. newer duplicates will replace older ones.
Non specific entries will just modify the older entries.
Default all numbers to decimal unless preceded by 0, (then it's hex)

5/15/2000 - .52d

FIX ontrig=timer not working timers (delete but no trigger ?) NOTE: There is no SRC in TIMER
Light spell now useable with light layer. CAST 68
SECTOR.SEASON default is 1
FIX SKILLCLASS caps for skills.
FIX - MAXCHARSPERACCOUNT - not working.
ADD - %GUILDLIST stuff% and %GMPAGELIST stuff%

5/10/2000 - .52c

EQUIPLIGHT hidden equipped light.

5/9/2000
REGEN3 = seconds til next food consumption. Was tenths of sec.
CHECK - animals tamed not follow commands? seems ok to me.
FIX- ON=EXIT for region triggers.
rename %SERVLISTCOL% to %LISTCOL%, so it can be used for %CLIENTLIST
add SECTOR.SEASON x or REGION.SECTORS SEASON x
FIX - not check crim flag on harmless stuff.

5/8/2000 - .52b

Main log server will list itself. (ie. BS2)
FIX stupid { -100 -200 } range problem. KARMA=-100 -200 is not working.
	Many triggers using STR=<STR>+x will be broken now !!!
New Refs for containers (both char and Item) FINDID, FINDCONT, FINDTYPE
New Ref for all TOPOBJ
some commands like RAIN,DRY and RESTOCK have moved to SECTOR. sub commands.
WEBPAGELOG=1 will log generated web pages daily.
CHECK- can't send email to hotmail accounts ?
Sphere will now act as a basic web server. Ex. http://localhost:2593/spherestatus.htm
 No external web server app is required.
 Only web pages listed in SPHERE.INI will be served.
 WebPages without a WEBPAGEDST will be generated on demand.
 Define WEBPAGEDST and not WEBPAGESRC to serv up pages not generated by the server.

----

4/29/2000 - Sphere .52

Vendor gold restock problems fixed. Restock time is now COLOR, in seconds
Allow multiple servers to register on the same ip address.
fix TARGET problems. TARGET is now the verb of the item being targetted (not SRC.TARGET)

----
4/28/2000 - Sphere 51b
ne tag LIGHTDAY to SPHERE.INI
Underground flag for regions should turn off weather. 
BUG - Still is a new client bug with waether in dungeons though.
?TEST - Vendors release too fast, even if paid way ahead
FIX - not criminal to heal yourself if you are evil.

use ARMOR instead of DEF for SChar armor base.
Get rid of MANA= and HITS= from CHAR.SCP. no need to set these.
HIREDAYWAGE= must come after NPC=, re-order all tags in the CHAR.SCP, use "-9" SphereSvr arg


----
September 3, 1999 Revision Notes:
As of this release all default vendors have been tested and none are selling unpriced or inappropriate items like rocks.  We are still getting reports of rocks in loot and have narrowed the problem down to magical random items. We're going to be changing how magical items are generated, so look for more notes later.  Please report any bugs at www.menasoft.com/tus


*ITEMS:
Growing Reagents, Contributed by Aphrodite! Thanks!
Added Growing Reagents to the items file (they're triggers, but see the items file.) You can grow and harvest these reagents -- and they may be used as reagents.  These properties were added to the default "growing" items themselves so if you have other triggers or purposes for these items, make sure that you're only making your changes to the tusitems2.scp file or your original work may not function properly.

Some have been fixed in the default scripts, some may still contain errors.
