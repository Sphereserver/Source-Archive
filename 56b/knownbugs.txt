Here is the list of known issues in the current Sphere Evolution project.
Some of them are subject of change in future versions, some will stay just in
knowledge base ;) forever.
So, please, do not report them as bugs.

- Since sphere assigns higher numeric ids to non-hardcoded types, 
  assigning tiles (with the syntax in sphere_types.scp) will not work.
- safe zone not disallowing explosion potion damage
- dropping an item under a wall with help of circle transpareny can be abused to
  steal items from a house
