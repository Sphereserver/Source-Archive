[== Exploits/Bugfixes ==]
- MOUNTHEIGHT=1 disallow walking in dunes: http://www.sphereserver.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=34534
- Writing .tag.name.prefix="xxx " will set name to "xxx name" while .x.tag.name.prefix="xxx " will
  strip the space naming as "xxxname"
- Spell defnames: when using for example "IF (<ARGN>==s_summon_creature)" the "s_summon_creature"
  returns the spell number plus 0c4000000, so the if would return false. This is valid also for
  skills but is skill number plus 0ba000000.
- Blue npcs won't call guards on anything but when they see a crime happening.
- I cannot put item directly on the Trade window, I have to put it directly on the player I want to
  trade with.
- When you double click something to attack while being in war mode, all your pets are currently
  rushing the target and attack it. You do not need to say "All Kill". This is exploitable to kill
  people/npcs in towns without being criminal. You only get flagged criminal if you target saying All Kill.
  What I am suggesting is to make it so, under a global hardcoded on=@gethit for either players, humans,
  monsters, well anything that could be hit, if the attacker has an OWNER, and that the owner is a 
  player, with a lot of if sentences checking for some memories, make it go criminal depending on the cases.

[== CRs (Change Requests) ==]
- More NPC cleverness, more usage of combo - paralyse + combat spells
- Get rid of amount in NAMES groups - autocount

[== New Features ==]
- TAG.ATEQUIP property of items to add/substract some skills, stats upon equip/unequip
	CVarDefBase *pAtEquip = pItem->m_TagDefs.GetKey("ATEQUIP");
	if ( pAtEquip )
	{
		CResourceQtyArray atequip;
		atequip.Load(pAtEquip->GetValStr());
		...
	}
- ON=@Karma, ON=@Fame
- @sawcrime called right after someone commits a crime and right before the npc see's the crime
- @NpcAction called when npc is selecting a skill to start
- Some new settings like CHEATINGDEATH=X,Y in ini. Sending packet X from @Login if set, grab
  the returning value and disconnect if it is not equal to Y. This will support providing
  simple interface with plugins over clients. (not needed anymore, packetfilter now accept values
  from 0 to 255 so this could be esily done using it)
- Daily snapshot - copies saves + scripts to one archive named YYYYMMDD.zip
- File server. NOT the http one - just special separated list of clients for transferring
  files needed for installation. In other words, ability working as a patch server.
- Allow taking items from your vendors/pets via paperdoll
- Criminal status not wear off in logout
- there should be a setting on how much % of resources you want to be lost when you fail to create an item.
- Make npc call guards whenever they have a red creature in their "screen area".
- There should be a setting like MOREY or something for containers, to set them bigger in size or
  smaller. Like, what if I'd want a magical picnic basket to hold chests? (I know I can make it hold them with 
  scripts, but as a player view I mean). By that way, I could also have a normal barrel be a trash barrel
  that would accepts anykind of bigger containers.
- EF_WALKCHECK takes tons of memory. Redo it by default with some cache file to store possibility to walk.
  Cache storage should be written for this. Actualy it should be configurable to be hold in RAM or HDD,
  and would be very useful for speeding up pathfinding, los checks and so on - holding block flags of
  all cells. It should at least contain all statics + static items, but actualy if good engine to
  autoupdate in separate thread will be done, it could contain also walkability using items and/or chars.
- Add NPCAI setting to chardef to specify the npc specifics to use the ai.
- Add a special file like spheretrig.map with the list of the triggers. People  uncomment lines there and
  get some more triggers executed. This will allow very customisable way of EF_Minimize_Triggers, yet fast.
- If IsServLoading() add:
  1. hits,stam,mana,food auto setting to str/dex/int,maxfood on writeval (if not set before)
  2. when saving if these stats equal to the max do not save them in saves.
